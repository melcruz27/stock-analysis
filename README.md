# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis is to compare the outcome of stocks in given years of 2017 and 2018. A refactoring of the code is to use an alternative to improve the delivery of all the stock outcomes.


## Results
In refactoring we can change the database pattern of the code without changing its external behavior and ultimately improve its design.

## Summary

###### Advantages:
copying and pasting can cause errors along the way, refactoring permits a new design to be more efficient. A new way may also provide more comprehensibility of the software at hand, it can change the way the developer thinks about the implementation. 

###### Disadvantages:
the structure of the code has changed but the outcome has remained the same, if not very similar. It can be very time consuming considering the outcome will amount to the same. If not precise it can also introduce new bugs and error in the code itself.
